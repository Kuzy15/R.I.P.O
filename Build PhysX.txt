Download PhysX SDK from github: clone this repository https://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/PhysX

Change vc15win32.xml in PhysX/physx/buildtools/presets/public param value to "False":
<cmakeSwitch name="NV_USE_STATIC_WINCRT" value="False" comment="Use the statically linked windows CRT" />
otherwise when compiling RIPO solution this error will appear:
Se detectaron diferencias para 'RuntimeLibrary': el valor 'MTd_StaticDebug' no coincide con el valor 'MDd_DynamicDebug' PhysXExtensions_static lib

Then change directory to physx/, run ./generate_projects.[bat|sh]
This will let you select a platform specific solution to build. You can then open the generated 
solution file with your IDE and kick off one or more configuration builds.
*Build for vc15win32*

When debug and release configurations are compiled copy the following dlls to folder Exes from R.I.P.O\Dependencies\physx\bin\win.x86_32.vc141.md\(debug or release):
PhysX_32
PhysXCommon_32
PhysXCooking_32
PhysXFoundation_32

Debug and Release dlls has the same name, so if you want to compile RIPO in debug copy dlls from the path sayed before and debug folder.
Else if you want release configuration copy them from release folder.

Requirements:
	Python 2.7.6 or later
	CMake 3.12 or later

Warning: for building the solution samples it is necessary to have installed Microsoft DirectX
SDK (June 2010). 
If you got Microsoft Visual c++ 2010 redistributable package already installed
in your pc the DirectX SDK installation will fail. 
In order to sucessfully install DirectX SDK you have to uninstall Microsoft Visual c++ 2010 
redistributable package (x86 and x64), 
install DirectX SDK and reinstall Microsoft Visual c++ 2010 redistributable package 
(open Windows Update and it will automatically install 2010 redistributable).
