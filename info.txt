WELCOME TO R.I.P.O.

Requirements:
	Python 2.7.6 or later
	CMake 3.12 or later


TO COMPILE:
1- PHYSX:
- Download PhysX SDK from github: clone this repository https://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/PhysX

- Change vc15win32.xml in PhysX/physx/buildtools/presets/public param value to "False":
<cmakeSwitch name="NV_USE_STATIC_WINCRT" value="False" comment="Use the statically linked windows CRT" />

- Change directory to physx/, run ./generate_projects.[bat|sh]
	This will let you select a platform specific solution to build. You can then open the generated 
	solution file with your IDE and kick off one or more configuration builds.
	*Build for vc15win32*

2- OIS -> INPUT
1. Download OIS from: https://sourceforge.net/projects/wgois/
2. Paste it to Dependencies folder
3. Open OIS solution
4. Change SDK in each project's properties 
5. Build solution in Release and Debug and also selecting OIS_DebugDLL and OIS_RealeaseDLL

3- OGRE:
- Download ogre-1.11.15 and transfer inside Dependencies
- Download CMake, transfer the "bin", "doc", "man" and "share" folders inside a new folder called CMake 
  at the same level as "Compiler".

- Open the CMD and cd into the folder "Compiler"
- write "gradlew compileCmake" -> this will generate the ogre library with CMake

4- DLLS
- Open the "Native Tools Command Prompt" of Visual Studio
- cd into the folder "Compiler"
- write "gradlew compileLib" -> this will compile the OGRE library and move the dlls so you can work
