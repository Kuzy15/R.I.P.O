WELCOME TO R.I.P.O.

To compile:
- Download CMake, transfer the "bin", "doc", "man" and "share" folders inside a new folder called CMake at the same level as "Compiler"
- Open the "Native Tools Command Prompt" of Visual Studio
- cd into the folder "Compiler"
- write "gradlew compile" -> this will compile the OGRE library and move the dlls so you can work
